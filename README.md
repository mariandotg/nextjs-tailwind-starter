# Next.js 13 Starter Template with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript

This is a starter template for creating projects with Next.js 13 using Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. It also includes a preconfigured setup of ESLint and Prettier that you can use in your projects.

## Features

- Next.js 13: The React framework for modern web applications.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework with low specificity.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript.
- ESLint: A linter that helps you maintain clean and consistent code.
- Prettier: A code formatter for maintaining a consistent code style.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed in your development environment:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Installation

Follow these steps to use this starter template:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/mariandotg/nextjs-tailwind-starter
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```
cd nombre-del-proyecto
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

## Usage

Once you have installed all the dependencies, you can start the local development server using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ESLint and Prettier Configuration

This template already includes a predefined configuration of ESLint and Prettier to help you maintain clean and consistent code.

You can find the ESLint configuration in the `.eslintrc` file. If you want to customize the ESLint rules, you can edit this file.

The Prettier configuration is located in the `.prettierrc` file. You can modify this file to adjust the formatting preferences according to your needs.
